# Voting-Dapp
The Voting Dapp is a decentralized application built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts. It allows users to participate in a transparent and tamper-proof voting process. Only the contract owner can add candidates and control the start and end of the voting session, while each participant is limited to a single, verifiable vote.
